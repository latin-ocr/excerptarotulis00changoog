ingram de Fenles certain debts due from William de
Fenles his father, and also his (the said Ingram’s) own
relies which he owed the King. The enrolment is can·
celled “ because on the Roll of the Slrl year.'' This is
evidently a mistake, since an enrolment ten years previous
could not have been theone meant; but the document
alluded to does not appear on the ntae Roll of this or
any subsequent year, and the only one met with, bearing
upon the subject, is on the Olore Roll of the alst year,
which was perhaps the one originally intended.l

What variation was made in the enrolment on the
'Liberate’ Roll of the aad year here referred to cannot
now be ascertained, since that Roll is unfortunately in a
state of great decay, and the part which contained the
period of this instrument is entirely gone.
