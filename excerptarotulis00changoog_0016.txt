PREFACE.

Puge 197.

From the title at the top of the Roll of the 89th
year, viz. “Fines de anuo Regis Homini tertii araim.
scoticorum comalio suo in Anglio dmn ficit in Vasconio‚'’
it might be inferred that the whole was the Justiciary's
Roll in England during the period of the King's absence;
whereas it will be seen that only about two months belong
to this title. The documenta “ tested '' by the Earl of
Comwall bear date from the aoth of October to the atuh
of December only, aster which there is a little space lest
on the Roll, and the irent instrument is tested by the
King at Faversham on the 81st of December.l

Pago aas, eos, seor.

The Membranes of the Rolls of the 41st, aad, and
‹lssd years have at different periods been numbered both
ways, from the top downwards and the reverse, either by
altering the figures or drawing the pen through them and
writing new ones. It does not appear when the alteration
was made3 and to prevent any inconvenience arising from

a different reference being given to the same membrana,
both numbers have been preserved, the cancelled ones
being printed within crotchets. ⁵
