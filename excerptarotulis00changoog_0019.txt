like the last, seems to be deficient for a certain period,
one small instrument being the only enrolment between
the send of June and the esth of August. A blank

of Evesham²‚ as that of Lewes in the preceding year,
occurring just at the period of the apparent deficiency,
tend greatly to strengthen the supposition expressed in the
last note.³
